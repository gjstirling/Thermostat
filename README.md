# Thermostat
Week 6 pair challenge

So far this code contains the business logic of a thremostat
- it sets a default temp 
- temperature can be lowered or increased 
- power saving can be enabled 
- there is a max and min temperature 

 # Interface 

The user can interact with this thermostat app by either: 
- Increaseing or decreasing temperature using the - or + clickable buttons 
- Enabling a power saving mode to implement a max temperature 
- Entering a city name to find the local current temperature
- Colours for usage currently isn't working 

 # CSS 

This is on my todo list to play around with design and CSS elements.
